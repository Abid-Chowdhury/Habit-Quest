                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Habit-Quest is a productivity app designed to assist users in setting goals, tracking daily
                    objectives, building habits, and fostering discipline. It accomplishes this by rewarding positive
                    behavior with cosmetics, achievements, and other incentives. Additionally, it penalizes users for
                    missing days or neglecting habits by deducting coins or potentially discouraging party members. The
                    app encourages users to socialize, exercise, journal, meditate, and effectively manage their time.
